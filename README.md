## Open Sauce

Don't let your spaghetti code stale by itself,  
Come stir it in with the rest in open sauce.  
For the biggest feast for all, bring from the shelf,  
Raspberries & chips, to be safe also salt.  

Go on, have a byte, chance upon an easter egg.  
No spoons here, but you're free to use a fork.  
Allow yourself cookies, down a full J-peg.  
Remix recipes, give and take a spaghetti block.
